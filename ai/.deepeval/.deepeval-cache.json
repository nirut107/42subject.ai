{"test_cases_lookup_map": {"{\"actual_output\": \"The `ft_transcendence` project builds upon and aims to strengthen skills and concepts developed throughout your journey in computer science, particularly from the \\\"Common Core.\\\"\\n\\nSpecific skills and concepts highlighted as relevant from this cumulative learning include:\\n\\n*   **Prompting skills** (both general-purpose and domain-specific).\\n*   **Effective use of AI tools** and understanding how AI systems work to anticipate and avoid common risks, biases, and ethical issues. This also involves only using AI-generated content that you `fully understand` and can take `responsibility for content`. These AI-related concepts and rules are shared across projects like `42_Collaborative_resume`, `inception`, `cub3D`, `miniRT`, `NetPractice`, `philosophers`, `so_long`, and `Push_swap`.\\n*   **Computational thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, and collaboration**. These are explicitly mentioned as continuing to be strengthened, indicating they are built from previous work. Projects such as `cub3D`, `NetPractice`, `philosophers`, `Minishell`, `fract\\u2019ol`, `fdf`, and `so_long` are also associated with strengthening these skills.\\n*   **Peer review and validation**: You should always `seek peer review` and `don\\u2019t rely solely on your own validation`. This practice is also relevant to projects like `42_Collaborative_resume`, `inception`, `Webserv`, `cub3D`, `philosophers`, `Minishell`, `fdf`, `so_long`, and `Born2beRoot`.\\n*   **Building both technical and power skills** by working with peers. This is directly linked to projects such as `miniRT`.\\n*   **Project understanding and modification**: Being prepared for `project modification` during evaluation to verify your understanding of a specific part of the project is a common practice across many projects, including `CPP Module 09`, `CPP Module 08`, `inception`, `ft_irc Internet Relay Chat`, `Webserv`, `miniRT`, `philosophers`, `Minishell`, `fract\\u2019ol`, `fdf`, `so_long`, `Push_swap`, `minitalk`, `get_next_line`, and `libft`.\\n*   **Documentation (`README.md` quality)**: The `README.md` is a critical part of project evaluation, which is a requirement shared with `inception`, `NetPractice`, `Push_swap`, `get_next_line`, `Born2beRoot`, and `libft`.\\n\\nWhile the context states this project involves \\\"tasks you have never done before\\\" and is a \\\"step forward from what you did previously in the Common Core,\\\" it emphasizes the *cumulative development of these core skills* rather than pointing to specific previous projects as definitive prerequisites beyond the general Common Core curriculum.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Which previous projects best prepare me for transcendence, and what specific skills or concepts from each project are most relevant?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"[ENTITY] 14+ points (Parameter)\\n  -

V.6 Specialized Projects These projects target specific niches or industries: \\u2022 Real-time Trading Simulator: Stock and cryptocurrency trading simulation with real-time data and portfolios.\\n\\nft_transcendence The `ft_transcendence` project is a challenging, mandatory group project for 4-5 students, serving as the final common core assignment to build a real-world web application. It emphasizes creativity, teamwork, and adaptability to new technologies.\\n\\nThe project is structured into two main parts:\\n1.  **Mandatory Core:** Fundamental requirements that every team must implement.\\n2.  **Modules:** Optional features, categorized as \\\"Major\\\" (2 points) or \\\"Minor\\\" (1 point), from which teams must select enough to accumulate a minimum of 14 points, allowing for project customization.\\n\\n**Key Requirements and Directives:**\\n\\n*   **AI Usage:** AI tools are encouraged for productivity, but learners are explicitly instructed to use them ethically, understand fully any generated content, and validate it through critical assessment and peer review. Responsibility for AI-generated content lies solely with the learner.\\n*   **Team Organization & Project Management:** Mandatory team roles (Product Owner, Project Manager, Technical Lead, and Developers) must be assigned, with clear responsibilities. Recommended practices include regular communication, task organization (e.g., GitHub Issues), code reviews, and documentation. All team members must actively contribute and be able to explain the entire project and their specific contributions.\\n*   **Mandatory Technical Part:** The application must be a web application with a frontend, backend, and a database. Key technical requirements include:\\n    *   Using Git with clear, distributed commits from all team members.\\n    *   Deployment via a containerization solution (e.g., Docker) with a single command.\\n    *   Compatibility with the latest Google Chrome (no browser console errors).\\n    *   Accessible Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages.\\n    *   Multi-user support, allowing concurrent actions without conflicts.\\n    *   A clear, responsive frontend using a CSS framework, and a clear database schema.\\n    *   Secure basic user management (signup/login with hashed and salted passwords).\\n    *   Robust validation for all forms and user inputs (frontend and backend).\\n    *   HTTPS usage everywhere in the backend.\\n*   **Module Selection:** A diverse range of modules are available across categories such as Web, Accessibility, User Management, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Gaming and User Experience, DevOps, Data and Analytics, and Blockchain. There are also \\\"Modules of Choice\\\" for custom implementations. Teams must justify their module selections, and only fully functional, properly implemented modules will count towards the 14-point total. Some modules have dependencies (e.g., game modules requiring an initial game implementation).\\n*   **Documentation (`README.md`):** A comprehensive `README.md` file is mandatory, detailing the project's description, installation instructions, resources (including how AI was specifically used), team information (roles, project management), technical stack, database schema, a complete features list, *all chosen modules with point calculations and justifications*, and detailed *individual contributions* from each team member.\\n*   **Evaluation:** Submission is through a Git repository. Teams must be prepared for potential brief modification requests during evaluation to verify their understanding of specific project parts.\\n\\nft_transcendence \\u25e6 The module should be relevant to your project context. \\u25e6 The module should be relevant to your project context. \\u2022 Minor: Same as the major module but smaller in scope and less complex. \\u25e6 Must still demonstrate technical skill and creativity. \\u25e6 Should add meaningful value to your project. \\u25e6 Requires justification in README.md (similar to Major, but for 1 point). 20 --- Page 22 --- Chapter V Project Ideas and Examples\\n\\nft_transcendence \\u2022 Interests your team and motivates everyone to work on it. \\u2022 Interests your team and motivates everyone to work on it. \\u2022 Allows you to implement the required modules (14 points minimum). \\u2022 Demonstrates technical complexity and creativity. \\u2022 Can be realistically completed within the project timeline. \\u2022 Has coherent module combinations that work well together.

V.6 Specialized Projects These projects target specific niches or industries: \\u2022 Real-time Trading Simulator: Stock and cryptocurrency trading simulation with real-time data and portfolios.\\n\\nft_transcendence The `ft_transcendence` project is a challenging, mandatory group project for 4-5 students, serving as the final common core assignment to build a real-world web application. It emphasizes creativity, teamwork, and adaptability to new technologies.\\n\\nThe project is structured into two main parts:\\n1.  **Mandatory Core:** Fundamental requirements that every team must implement.\\n2.  **Modules:** Optional features, categorized as \\\"Major\\\" (2 points) or \\\"Minor\\\" (1 point), from which teams must select enough to accumulate a minimum of 14 points, allowing for project customization.\\n\\n**Key Requirements and Directives:**\\n\\n*   **AI Usage:** AI tools are encouraged for productivity, but learners are explicitly instructed to use them ethically, understand fully any generated content, and validate it through critical assessment and peer review. Responsibility for AI-generated content lies solely with the learner.\\n*   **Team Organization & Project Management:** Mandatory team roles (Product Owner, Project Manager, Technical Lead, and Developers) must be assigned, with clear responsibilities. Recommended practices include regular communication, task organization (e.g., GitHub Issues), code reviews, and documentation. All team members must actively contribute and be able to explain the entire project and their specific contributions.\\n*   **Mandatory Technical Part:** The application must be a web application with a frontend, backend, and a database. Key technical requirements include:\\n    *   Using Git with clear, distributed commits from all team members.\\n    *   Deployment via a containerization solution (e.g., Docker) with a single command.\\n    *   Compatibility with the latest Google Chrome (no browser console errors).\\n    *   Accessible Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages.\\n    *   Multi-user support, allowing concurrent actions without conflicts.\\n    *   A clear, responsive frontend using a CSS framework, and a clear database schema.\\n    *   Secure basic user management (signup/login with hashed and salted passwords).\\n    *   Robust validation for all forms and user inputs (frontend and backend).\\n    *   HTTPS usage everywhere in the backend.\\n*   **Module Selection:** A diverse range of modules are available across categories such as Web, Accessibility, User Management, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Gaming and User Experience, DevOps, Data and Analytics, and Blockchain. There are also \\\"Modules of Choice\\\" for custom implementations. Teams must justify their module selections, and only fully functional, properly implemented modules will count towards the 14-point total. Some modules have dependencies (e.g., game modules requiring an initial game implementation).\\n*   **Documentation (`README.md`):** A comprehensive `README.md` file is mandatory, detailing the project's description, installation instructions, resources (including how AI was specifically used), team information (roles, project management), technical stack, database schema, a complete features list, *all chosen modules with point calculations and justifications*, and detailed *individual contributions* from each team member.\\n*   **Evaluation:** Submission is through a Git repository. Teams must be prepared for potential brief modification requests during evaluation to verify their understanding of specific project parts.\\n\\nft_transcendence \\u25e6 The module should be relevant to your project context. \\u25e6 The module should be relevant to your project context. \\u2022 Minor: Same as the major module but smaller in scope and less complex. \\u25e6 Must still demonstrate technical skill and creativity. \\u25e6 Should add meaningful value to your project. \\u25e6 Requires justification in README.md (similar to Major, but for 1 point). 20 --- Page 22 --- Chapter V Project Ideas and Examples\\n\\nft_transcendence \\u2022 Interests your team and motivates everyone to work on it. \\u2022 Interests your team and motivates everyone to work on it. \\u2022 Allows you to implement the required modules (14 points minimum). \\u2022 Demonstrates technical complexity and creativity. \\u2022 Can be realistically completed within the project timeline. \\u2022 Has coherent module combinations that work well together.

Yes, you have to bring your own ideas and decide together what application to build as a team. It\\u2019s a step forward from what you did previously in the Common Core. You need to think about the project as a whole, not just the features you\\u2019re going to implement.

V.6 Specialized Projects These projects target specific niches or industries: \\u2022 Real-time Trading Simulator: Stock and cryptocurrency trading simulation with real-time data and portfolios.\\n\\nft_transcendence The `ft_transcendence` project is a challenging, mandatory group project for 4-5 students, serving as the final common core assignment to build a real-world web application. It emphasizes creativity, teamwork, and adaptability to new technologies.\\n\\nThe project is structured into two main parts:\\n1.  **Mandatory Core:** Fundamental requirements that every team must implement.\\n2.  **Modules:** Optional features, categorized as \\\"Major\\\" (2 points) or \\\"Minor\\\" (1 point), from which teams must select enough to accumulate a minimum of 14 points, allowing for project customization.\\n\\n**Key Requirements and Directives:**\\n\\n*   **AI Usage:** AI tools are encouraged for productivity, but learners are explicitly instructed to use them ethically, understand fully any generated content, and validate it through critical assessment and peer review. Responsibility for AI-generated content lies solely with the learner.\\n*   **Team Organization & Project Management:** Mandatory team roles (Product Owner, Project Manager, Technical Lead, and Developers) must be assigned, with clear responsibilities. Recommended practices include regular communication, task organization (e.g., GitHub Issues), code reviews, and documentation. All team members must actively contribute and be able to explain the entire project and their specific contributions.\\n*   **Mandatory Technical Part:** The application must be a web application with a frontend, backend, and a database. Key technical requirements include:\\n    *   Using Git with clear, distributed commits from all team members.\\n    *   Deployment via a containerization solution (e.g., Docker) with a single command.\\n    *   Compatibility with the latest Google Chrome (no browser console errors).\\n    *   Accessible Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages.\\n    *   Multi-user support, allowing concurrent actions without conflicts.\\n    *   A clear, responsive frontend using a CSS framework, and a clear database schema.\\n    *   Secure basic user management (signup/login with hashed and salted passwords).\\n    *   Robust validation for all forms and user inputs (frontend and backend).\\n    *   HTTPS usage everywhere in the backend.\\n*   **Module Selection:** A diverse range of modules are available across categories such as Web, Accessibility, User Management, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Gaming and User Experience, DevOps, Data and Analytics, and Blockchain. There are also \\\"Modules of Choice\\\" for custom implementations. Teams must justify their module selections, and only fully functional, properly implemented modules will count towards the 14-point total. Some modules have dependencies (e.g., game modules requiring an initial game implementation).\\n*   **Documentation (`README.md`):** A comprehensive `README.md` file is mandatory, detailing the project's description, installation instructions, resources (including how AI was specifically used), team information (roles, project management), technical stack, database schema, a complete features list, *all chosen modules with point calculations and justifications*, and detailed *individual contributions* from each team member.\\n*   **Evaluation:** Submission is through a Git repository. Teams must be prepared for potential brief modification requests during evaluation to verify their understanding of specific project parts.\\n\\nft_transcendence \\u25e6 The module should be relevant to your project context. \\u25e6 The module should be relevant to your project context. \\u2022 Minor: Same as the major module but smaller in scope and less complex. \\u25e6 Must still demonstrate technical skill and creativity. \\u25e6 Should add meaningful value to your project. \\u25e6 Requires justification in README.md (similar to Major, but for 1 point). 20 --- Page 22 --- Chapter V Project Ideas and Examples\\n\\nft_transcendence \\u2022 Interests your team and motivates everyone to work on it. \\u2022 Interests your team and motivates everyone to work on it. \\u2022 Allows you to implement the required modules (14 points minimum). \\u2022 Demonstrates technical complexity and creativity. \\u2022 Can be realistically completed within the project timeline. \\u2022 Has coherent module combinations that work well together.

Yes, you have to bring your own ideas and decide together what application to build as a team. It\\u2019s a step forward from what you did previously in the Common Core. You need to think about the project as a whole, not just the features you\\u2019re going to implement. Of course, you won\\u2019t be completely free\\u2014there are constraints\\u2014but the idea is yours.
