The process involves preparing questions, conducting structured interviews, writing clear and well-structured resumes (submitted as PDFs from a standard format like MarkDown, LaTeX, or DOCX), and exchanging/reviewing them for constructive feedback. Students must also prepare for an oral interview about the submitted resumes.\n\n**Key Instructions and Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **AI Usage:** AI tools should be used judiciously to reduce tedious tasks and develop prompting skills. Users must critically assess AI-generated content, understand its risks and biases, and always seek peer review. Copying AI output without full understanding or responsibility is strictly prohibited.\n2.  **Roles:** Each partner serves as both an interviewer (recruiter) and an interviewee (candidate).\n3.  **Submission:** The project requires a `collaborative_resume` folder containing two PDF resumes (e.g., `resume_[login1].pdf`, `resume_[login2].pdf`) and a `media` folder with two text files (e.g., `media_[login1].txt`, `media_[login2].txt`), each containing a public professional social media URL (LinkedIn is advised).\n4.  **Privacy & Ethics:**\n    *   Exclude any private data from resumes.\n    *   Do not publish resumes that do not belong to you.\n    *   The professional social media profile must be public during peer-evaluation.\n    *   All intermediate and final documents (including the resumes) must be deleted from the repository after project validation.\n\nThe project is framed within a scenario where students are new recruits at \"Technov,\" a tech talent marketplace, tasked by their manager with creating compelling resumes for top tech talents."

It emphasizes creativity, teamwork, and adaptability to new technologies.\n\nThe project is structured into two main parts:\n1.  **Mandatory Core:** Fundamental requirements that every team must implement.\n2.  **Modules:** Optional features, categorized as \"Major\" (2 points) or \"Minor\" (1 point), from which teams must select enough to accumulate a minimum of 14 points, allowing for project customization.\n\n**Key Requirements and Directives:**\n\n*   **AI Usage:** AI tools are encouraged for productivity, but learners are explicitly instructed to use them ethically, understand fully any generated content, and validate it through critical assessment and peer review. Responsibility for AI-generated content lies solely with the learner.\n*   **Team Organization & Project Management:** Mandatory team roles (Product Owner, Project Manager, Technical Lead, and Developers) must be assigned, with clear responsibilities. Recommended practices include regular communication, task organization (e.g., GitHub Issues), code reviews, and documentation. All team members must actively contribute and be able to explain the entire project and their specific contributions.\n*   **Mandatory Technical Part:** The application must be a web application with a frontend, backend, and a database. Key technical requirements include:\n    *   Using Git with clear, distributed commits from all team members.\n    *   Deployment via a containerization solution (e.g., Docker) with a single command.\n    *   Compatibility with the latest Google Chrome (no browser console errors).\n    *   Accessible Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages.\n    *   Multi-user support, allowing concurrent actions without conflicts.\n    *   A clear, responsive frontend using a CSS framework, and a clear database schema.\n    *   Secure basic user management (signup/login with hashed and salted passwords).\n    *   Robust validation for all forms and user inputs (frontend and backend).\n    *   HTTPS usage everywhere in the backend.\n*   **Module Selection:** A diverse range of modules are available across categories such as Web, Accessibility, User Management, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Gaming and User Experience, DevOps, Data and Analytics, and Blockchain. There are also \"Modules of Choice\" for custom implementations. Teams must justify their module selections, and only fully functional, properly implemented modules will count towards the 14-point total. Some modules have dependencies (e.g., game modules requiring an initial game implementation).\n*   **Documentation (`README.md`):** A comprehensive `README.md` file is mandatory, detailing the project's description, installation instructions, resources (including how AI was specifically used), team information (roles, project management), technical stack, database schema, a complete features list, *all chosen modules with point calculations and justifications*, and detailed *individual contributions* from each team member.\n*   **Evaluation:** Submission is through a Git repository. Teams must be prepared for potential brief modification requests during evaluation to verify their understanding of specific project parts."

It serves as an exercise guide for students learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, adhering to the **C++98 standard**.\n\n**Key aspects and rules include:**\n\n*   **Compilation:** Code must compile with `c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`.\n*   **Naming Conventions:** Classes use UpperCamelCase.\n*   **Forbidden Features:** C++11/Boost libraries, `*printf()`, `*alloc()`, `free()`, `using namespace <ns_name>`, and `friend` keywords are explicitly forbidden.\n*   **STL Usage:** The STL (including containers like `vector`, `list`, `map`, and algorithms) is **only permitted in Modules 08 and 09**.\n*   **Module-Specific Container Rule (Crucial): Each standard container can only be used once across all exercises within this module.**\n*   **Design:** Classes must follow the Orthodox Canonical Form, avoid memory leaks, and headers must use include guards without function implementations (except templates).\n*   **AI Instructions:** Students are strongly advised to use AI tools thoughtfully for learning, not for obtaining direct answers, emphasizing genuine intellectual effort and peer-learning.\n\nThe module presents three programming exercises:\n\n1.  **Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange (`btc`)**: Create a program to calculate Bitcoin values based on a given date and amount, using a provided CSV database. It must parse \"date | value\" input, handle errors, and use the closest *lower* date if an exact match isn't found in the database. **Requires one standard container.**\n2.  **Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation (`RPN`)**: Implement a program to evaluate RPN mathematical expressions (e.g., \"8 9 * 9 -\") provided as an argument. It must handle `+ - / *` operations with numbers less than 10. **Requires a different standard container** than used in Exercise 00.\n3.  **Exercise 02: PmergeMe**: Develop a program to sort a sequence of positive integers using the Merge-Insert (Ford-Johnson) algorithm. It needs to handle at least 3000 integers and display the unsorted sequence, sorted sequence, and the time taken for sorting using **two distinct standard containers** (both different from each other and from those used in previous exercises).\n\nSubmissions are done via Git, with potential for minor code modifications during peer evaluation to verify understanding."

It contains a set of exercises designed to introduce these concepts.\n\n**Key Requirements & General Rules:**\n*   All code must comply with the **C++98 standard**.\n*   Compilation requires `c++` with flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`.\n*   No specific coding style (Norminette) is enforced, but readability is crucial.\n*   **Forbidden:** C++11/Boost libraries, `*printf()`, `*alloc()`, `free()`, `using namespace <ns_name>`, and `friend` (unless explicitly allowed).\n*   **Crucially, this module (and Module 09) explicitly allows and *requires* the use of the Standard Template Library (STL), specifically containers (like `vector`, `list`, `map`) and algorithms (from `<algorithm>`), wherever appropriate.** Failure to use them will result in a very bad grade.\n*   Classes must follow the Orthodox Canonical Form, and memory leaks must be avoided.\n*   Function implementations (except for templates) are forbidden in header files. Template definitions can be in `.hpp` or `.tpp` files.\n\n**AI Usage Guidelines:**\n*   Emphasizes foundational learning and skill development over seeking direct answers from AI.\n*   Learners should apply their own reasoning before consulting AI.\n*   The focus is on the learning journey, peer-learning, and understanding the risks and proper use of AI as a tool.\n\n**Exercises:**\n1.  **Exercise 00: Easy find:** Implement a function template `easyfind` that accepts a container (type `T`) and an integer. It must find the first occurrence of the integer in the container, throwing an exception or returning an error value if not found.\n2.  **Exercise 01: Span:** Develop a `Span` class that can store a maximum of `N` integers. It must include:\n    *   `addNumber()`: Adds a single number, throwing an exception if the Span is full.\n    *   `shortestSpan()`: Returns the shortest distance between stored numbers, throwing if less than two numbers are stored.\n    *   `longestSpan()`: Returns the longest distance between stored numbers, throwing if less than two numbers are stored.\n    *   An additional member function to add multiple numbers using a range of iterators (e.g., from another container). Extensive testing (at least 10,000 numbers) is required.\n3.  **Exercise 02: Mutated abomination:** Create a `MutantStack` class, implemented in terms of `std::stack`, that offers all `std::stack`'s member functions plus the additional feature of iterators (`begin()` and `end()`), making it iterable.\n\n**Submission and Evaluation:**\nAssignments are submitted to a Git repository. During evaluation, minor modifications may be requested to verify the learner's understanding of specific project parts."

It details general rules, guidelines for using AI as a learning tool, three programming exercises, and submission instructions.\n\n**General Rules & Restrictions:**\n*   Code must compile with `c++` using flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`.\n*   Naming conventions include `exNN` directories and UpperCamelCase for class names.\n*   **Crucial Restrictions:** Only C++98 standard is allowed. Forbidden functions include `*printf()`, `*alloc()`, `free()`. External libraries (C++11, Boost, etc.) are prohibited. `using namespace` and `friend` keywords are generally forbidden. STL containers and algorithms (`<algorithm>` header) are restricted until Modules 08 and 09.\n*   Design principles include avoiding memory leaks, adhering to the Orthodox Canonical Form (where applicable), using include guards, and placing function template implementations solely in header files.\n\n**AI Usage Guidelines:**\n*   Emphasizes foundational learning, critical thinking, and intellectual effort *before* resorting to AI.\n*   Learners should avoid asking AI for direct answers to exercises.\n*   Stresses the importance of peer learning and developing problem-solving skills over AI reliance, noting that AI won't be available during exams.\n\n**Exercises:**\n1.  **Exercise 00: Start with a few functions:** Implement `swap`, `min`, and `max` as **function templates**. These functions must be generic, accept two parameters of the same type (which support comparison operators), and their definitions must be in header files.\n2.  **Exercise 01: Iter:** Implement an `iter` **function template** that takes three parameters: the address of an array, its length, and a function to apply to every element. It must work with any array type and accommodate functions taking const or non-const references.\n3.  **Exercise 02: Array:** Develop an `Array` **class template** that holds elements of type `T`. It must include:\n    *   Constructors for creating empty arrays or arrays of `n` default-initialized elements.\n    *   A deep copy constructor and assignment operator to ensure independent copies.\n    *   Memory allocation exclusively via `new[]`, with no preventive allocation.\n    *   Element access through the `[]` subscript operator, which throws an `std::exception` for out-of-bounds indices.\n    *   A `const size()` member function to return the number of elements.\n\n**Submission:**\nAssignments are submitted via a Git repository. Learners should be prepared for potential brief code modifications requested during evaluation to verify their understanding."

No Norminette style enforced, but readability is key.\n    *   **Allowed/Forbidden:** Use C++-ish standard library functions; **forbidden** are external libraries, C++11/Boost, C-style functions like `*printf()`, `*alloc()`, `free()`, `using namespace <ns_name>` and `friend` (unless specified), and STL containers/algorithms until Module 08/09.\n    *   **Design:** Prevent memory leaks, design classes in Orthodox Canonical Form (M02-M09), use include guards, and avoid function implementations in header files (except templates).\n3.  **Module-Specific Rule:** All type conversions in this module **must** be handled using a specific type of C++ casting, to be reviewed during evaluation.\n4.  **AI Instructions:** Emphasizes foundational learning, critical thinking, and peer collaboration over relying on AI for direct answers, warning against its misuse in learning and exams.\n5.  **Exercises:**\n    *   **Exercise 00: Conversion of scalar types:** Implement a non-instantiable `ScalarConverter` class with a static `convert` method. It takes a string representing a C++ literal (char, int, float, double, including pseudo-literals like `inf`, `nan`) and outputs its value in all four scalar types, handling impossible or non-displayable conversions.\n    *   **Exercise 01: Serialization:** Implement a non-instantiable `Serializer` class with static methods `serialize` (converts `Data*` to `uintptr_t`) and `deserialize` (converts `uintptr_t` back to `Data*`). The task is to create a `Data` structure, serialize its address, deserialize it, and verify the original and deserialized pointers are identical.\n    *   **Exercise 02: Identify real type:** Create a `Base` class with a public virtual destructor and three empty inheriting classes (`A`, `B`, `C`). Implement `generate()` to randomly instantiate and return a `Base*`, and `identify()` functions (one taking `Base*`, one taking `Base&`) to print the actual type (\"A\", \"B\", or \"C\") without using `std::typeinfo`.\n6.  **Submission:** Assignments are submitted via Git, and students should be prepared for minor, on-the-spot modifications during the peer evaluation to confirm understanding."

STL containers/algorithms are forbidden until Modules 08/09.\n    *   Design requirements: Avoid memory leaks, adhere to **Orthodox Canonical Form** (except for exception classes), use include guards, and avoid function implementations in header files (except for templates).\n    *   No specific coding style (Norminette) is enforced, but readability is paramount.\n*   **AI Instructions:** Emphasizes using AI as a learning tool for reasoning and problem-solving, not for direct answers or shortcuts, to build strong foundational skills and promote peer-learning.\n*   **Exercises:**\n\n    *   **Exercise 00: Bureaucrat:** Implement a `Bureaucrat` class with a `const name` and a `grade` (1-150). Focus on **exception handling** for invalid grades (`GradeTooHighException`, `GradeTooLowException`) during construction, incrementing, and decrementing the grade. Includes `operator<<` overload for output.\n    *   **Exercise 01: Form:** Implement a `Form` class with a `const name`, `isSigned` status, and `const gradeToSign` and `const gradeToExecute` attributes. Introduces exception handling for invalid form grades. The `beSigned()` member function allows a `Bureaucrat` to sign the form, throwing an exception if the bureaucrat's grade is too low. The `Bureaucrat` class is extended with a `signForm()` function to interact with `Form` objects.\n    *   **Exercise 02: AForm & Specific Forms:** The `Form` class becomes an **abstract base class (`AForm`)**. Three concrete derived classes are introduced: `ShrubberyCreationForm`, `RobotomyRequestForm`, and `PresidentialPardonForm`, each with specific signing and execution grade requirements and unique actions. The `AForm` class gets an `execute()` member function to check signing and grade requirements, throwing exceptions if not met. The `Bureaucrat` class is extended with `executeForm()` to execute `AForm` objects.\n    *   **Exercise 03: Intern:** Implement an `Intern` class with a `makeForm()` function. This function takes a form name (string) and a target (string) as parameters, dynamically creating and returning a pointer to the corresponding `AForm` object (e.g., \"robotomy request\" for `RobotomyRequestForm`). It should handle unknown form names and **avoid unreadable `if/else if/else` structures** for form creation.\n\n*   **Submission:** Standard Git repository submission, with a note to be prepared for minor code modifications during peer evaluation."

This infrastructure must include:\n*   An **NGINX** container configured with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3, acting as the sole entrypoint on port 443.\n*   A **WordPress** container running with php-fpm (without NGINX).\n*   A **MariaDB** database container (without NGINX).\n*   All services must run in dedicated containers, built from custom Dockerfiles based on Alpine or Debian (prohibiting pre-made Docker images, except for the base OS).\n*   **Persistent storage** is required through two named Docker volumes: one for the WordPress database and another for its website files, with data stored on the host machine at `/home/login/data`. Bind mounts are forbidden.\n*   Containers must communicate via a dedicated **Docker network**.\n\nKey configuration rules emphasize using environment variables (stored in a `.env` file) and strongly recommending Docker secrets for sensitive information (passwords, API keys), which must not be hardcoded in Dockerfiles or publicly exposed. Containers should restart on crash and must not use infinite loops as their main command. The project requires configuring a custom domain `login.42.fr` to point to the local IP address.\n\nThe project also demands comprehensive **documentation**, including a `README.md` (detailing project goals, instructions, AI usage, and comparisons between VM/Docker, Secrets/Env Vars, Docker Network/Host Network, Docker Volumes/Bind Mounts), a `USER_DOC.md`, and a `DEV_DOC.md`.\n\n**AI usage** is encouraged for repetitive tasks and skill development, but with strict guidelines: results must be critically assessed, peer-reviewed, fully understood, and not blindly copied, as unverified AI-generated content can lead to project failure.\n\nAn optional **bonus part** allows for additional services (e.g., Redis cache for WordPress, FTP server, a static website, Adminer), which will only be evaluated if the mandatory part is perfectly completed. Evaluation involves submission to a Git repository and a potential live modification exercise to verify understanding."

However, they must critically assess AI-generated content, ensure full understanding, take responsibility for it, and prioritize peer review over sole AI reliance (copy-pasting AI code without understanding is explicitly discouraged).\n4.  **Mandatory Part:**\n    *   **Program:** `ircserv`, executed with `<port> <password>`.\n    *   **Restrictions:** No IRC client implementation, no server-to-server communication.\n    *   **Technical Requirements:** Handle multiple clients simultaneously with non-blocking I/O, using only one `poll()` (or equivalent like `select`, `kqueue`, `epoll`) for all operations. Communication must be via TCP/IP (v4 or v6).\n    *   **IRC Features:** Implement user authentication, setting nicknames and usernames, joining channels, sending and receiving private messages, and forwarding channel messages to all participants.\n    *   **User Types:** Differentiate between operators and regular users.\n    *   **Operator Commands:** Implement `KICK` (eject client), `INVITE` (to channel), `TOPIC` (view/change channel topic), and `MODE` (to change channel settings: `i` for invite-only, `t` for topic restrictions, `k` for channel key/password, `o` for operator privilege, `l` for user limit).\n    *   **Code Quality:** Emphasize clean code and robust error handling (e.g., partial data).\n5.  **Bonus Part:** Additional features like file transfer or a bot can be added, but only if the mandatory part is perfectly implemented and functional.\n6.  **Submission and Evaluation:** Projects are submitted to a Git repository. A reference IRC client will be used for evaluation. Students should be prepared for potential on-the-spot code modifications during evaluation to verify their understanding."

It emphasizes the importance of genuine intellectual effort, problem-solving, and peer-learning to build strong foundations, as AI reliance hinders these critical learning outcomes.\n\n**Exercises:**\n1.  **Exercise 00: Polymorphism:** Implement `Animal` as a base class, with `Dog` and `Cat` as derived classes. Demonstrate polymorphism using a virtual `makeSound()` function. Also, implement `WrongAnimal` and `WrongCat` to show behavior without virtual functions.\n2.  **Exercise 01: I don’t want to set the world on fire:** Introduce a `Brain` class with 100 `std::string` ideas. `Dog` and `Cat` objects will now have a dynamically allocated `Brain*` attribute, requiring proper memory management (new/delete) and **deep copying** for these objects. Tests involve an array of `Animal` pointers to verify correct destructor calls and memory leak prevention.\n3.  **Exercise 02: Abstract class:** Modify the `Animal` class to be **abstract** (non-instantiable) since it makes no sound, ensuring derived classes are still functional.\n4.  **Exercise 03: Interface & recap (Optional):** This comprehensive exercise focuses on \"interfaces\" (pure abstract classes in C++98). It requires implementing:\n    *   `AMateria` (abstract base) with `clone()` (pure virtual) and `use()`.\n    *   Concrete `Ice` and `Cure` Materias.\n    *   `ICharacter` (interface) for characters to `equip`, `unequip`, and `use` Materias in a 4-slot inventory, requiring **deep copies** of Materias upon character copy.\n    *   `IMateriaSource` (interface) to `learnMateria` (store templates) and `createMateria` (generate copies based on type).\n    This exercise tests advanced OOP concepts, memory management, and design patterns.\n\n**Submission:** Standard Git repository submission, with a possibility of minor modifications during peer evaluation."

No specific coding style enforced beyond readability.\n    *   **Allowed/Forbidden:** Standard library is mostly allowed, but `printf()`, `alloc()`, `free()`, `using namespace`, `friend`, and STL containers/algorithms (until Module 08/09) are strictly forbidden. Memory leaks must be avoided.\n    *   **Design:** Classes must adhere to Orthodox Canonical Form, no function implementations in header files (except templates), and include guards are mandatory.\n3.  **AI Instructions:** Students are encouraged to use AI tools thoughtfully, focusing on genuine intellectual effort, peer-learning, and understanding the \"why\" rather than just getting direct answers. The learning journey and skill development are prioritized over shortcuts.\n4.  **Exercises:** The module consists of four exercises designed to progressively introduce inheritance:\n    *   **Ex00: ClapTrap:** Implement a base `ClapTrap` class with attributes (name, hit points, energy points, attack damage) and member functions (`attack`, `takeDamage`, `beRepaired`). All actions and constructor/destructor calls must print descriptive messages.\n    *   **Ex01: ScavTrap:** Create `ScavTrap`, which inherits from `ClapTrap`. It has different default attribute values (higher HP, energy, damage), unique constructor/destructor messages, and a special `guardGate()` ability. Proper construction/destruction chaining is required.\n    *   **Ex02: FragTrap:** Implement `FragTrap`, also inheriting from `ClapTrap`. Similar to `ScavTrap`, it has its own distinct constructor/destructor messages, different attribute values (again, higher HP, energy, damage), and a special `highFivesGuys()` function.\n    *   **Ex03: DiamondTrap (Optional):** This exercise involves multiple inheritance, creating `DiamondTrap` which inherits from *both* `FragTrap` and `ScavTrap`. It has its own private `name` attribute, specific attribute values (e.g., HP from FragTrap, energy from ScavTrap), and a unique `whoAmI()` method displaying both its name and its `ClapTrap` name. A key challenge is ensuring the `ClapTrap` instance is created only once.\n5.  **Submission and Peer-Evaluation:** Assignments are submitted via a Git repository. Students should be prepared for brief code modifications during evaluation to verify their understanding."

No specific coding style (Norminette) is enforced, but readability is crucial.\n*   **Allowed/Forbidden:** Most standard library features are allowed, but `*printf()`, `*alloc()`, `free()`, `using namespace`, `friend`, and STL containers/algorithms (until Modules 08/09) are forbidden.\n*   **Orthodox Canonical Form:** All classes from this module onwards must adhere to this form, implementing a **Default constructor, Copy constructor, Copy assignment operator, and Destructor**.\n*   **AI Usage:** Strict guidelines are provided, emphasizing genuine learning, reasoning, and peer-learning over using AI for direct answers.\n\nThe module progresses through several exercises:\n\n*   **Exercise 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form**\n    *   Create a `Fixed` class representing a fixed-point number.\n    *   It must be in Orthodox Canonical Form.\n    *   Private members: an `int` for the value and a `static const int` for 8 fractional bits.\n    *   Public members: Orthodox Canonical Form elements, `getRawBits()`, and `setRawBits()`.\n\n*   **Exercise 01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class**\n    *   Enhance the `Fixed` class.\n    *   Add constructors that take a `const int` and a `const float` to convert them to fixed-point values.\n    *   Add `toFloat()` and `toInt()` member functions for conversion.\n    *   Overload the insertion (`<<`) operator to output the `Fixed` number as a floating-point value.\n\n*   **Exercise 02: Now we’re talking**\n    *   Further expand the `Fixed` class's functionality.\n    *   Overload six comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`).\n    *   Overload four arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).\n    *   Overload four increment/decrement operators (pre-increment, post-increment, pre-decrement, post-decrement).\n    *   Add static `min` and `max` member functions (with `const` and non-`const` overloads).\n\n*   **Exercise 03: BSP (Optional)**\n    *   Implement a `bsp` function to determine if a point is inside a triangle.\n    *   Requires creating a `Point` class (in Orthodox Canonical Form) with `Fixed const x` and `y` attributes.\n\nThe document concludes with submission instructions and notes on peer evaluation, including the possibility of on-the-spot modifications."

The module focuses on core C++ concepts such as **memory allocation (stack and heap), pointers, references, classes, objects, string manipulation, file I/O, switch statements, and specifically, pointers to member functions**.\n\nKey aspects covered include:\n\n*   **General Rules:** Strict compilation flags (`-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`), class naming conventions (UpperCamelCase), and a flexible coding style (no \"Norminette\" but emphasizes readability). It defines **allowed** (most of the standard C++ library, preferring C++-ish versions) and **forbidden** elements (C++11/Boost, C-style memory allocation/printf functions, `using namespace` and `friend` keywords unless specified, and STL containers/algorithms until later modules). Design principles like avoiding memory leaks, using include guards, and adhering to the Orthodox Canonical Form (from Module 02) are also stressed.\n*   **AI Instructions:** Emphasizes that students must prioritize genuine intellectual effort, critical thinking, and peer-learning over using AI tools for direct answers or shortcuts. AI is acknowledged but restricted during this foundational phase to ensure deep understanding.\n*   **Exercises (00-06):**\n    *   **Ex00 & Ex01:** Implement a `Zombie` class, explore stack vs. heap memory allocation, and create a horde of zombies.\n    *   **Ex02:** Demystify references by comparing memory addresses and values of a string, its pointer, and its reference.\n    *   **Ex03:** Develop `Weapon`, `HumanA`, and `HumanB` classes to illustrate the practical use of pointers and references with objects.\n    *   **Ex04:** Create a program to replace all occurrences of a substring in a file without using `std::string::replace`.\n    *   **Ex05:** Implement a `Harl` class with a `complain` method that uses **pointers to member functions** to handle different log levels (\"DEBUG\", \"INFO\", \"WARNING\", \"ERROR\").\n    *   **Ex06:** Develop a \"Harl filter\" program that displays `Harl`'s complaints from a specified log level and above, utilizing a **switch statement**.\n*   **Submission and Evaluation:** Assignments are submitted via Git for peer-evaluation, which may include requests for minor code modifications to verify understanding."

No specific coding style (Norminette) is enforced, but readability is crucial.\n*   **Allowed/Forbidden:**\n    *   The C++ standard library is generally allowed.\n    *   Forbidden: C++11 (and derived forms), Boost libraries, `*printf()`, `*alloc()`, `free()`.\n    *   Forbidden (with -42 grade penalty): `using namespace <ns_name>`, `friend` keyword.\n    *   **Crucially, STL containers (vector, list, map, etc.) and algorithms are forbidden until Modules 08 and 09.**\n*   **Design:** Memory leaks must be avoided. Classes from Module 02 onwards must follow the Orthodox Canonical Form. Function implementations in header files (except templates) are forbidden. Headers require include guards.\n\n**AI Usage Guidelines:**\nThe document strongly emphasizes foundational learning and critical thinking. Learners are encouraged to apply reasoning before turning to AI tools, avoid asking for direct answers, and prioritize peer-learning. AI is seen as a tool for understanding *after* genuine effort, not for shortcuts, and will not be available in exams.\n\n**Exercises:**\n1.  **Exercise 00: Megaphone:** Create a program that converts command-line arguments to uppercase.\n2.  **Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook:** Implement `PhoneBook` and `Contact` classes. The PhoneBook stores a maximum of 8 contacts (replacing the oldest if full, without dynamic allocation). It supports `ADD`, `SEARCH`, and `EXIT` commands, with specific input/output formatting rules for contact information.\n3.  **Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams:** Recreate a missing `Account.cpp` file based on a provided `Account.hpp` header and a log file. This exercise is not mandatory to pass the module.\n\n**Submission and Evaluation:**\nAssignments are submitted to a Git repository. Peer evaluations may include requests for minor, on-the-spot code modifications to verify understanding."

The project aims to enhance skills in C programming, basic algorithms, graphic design (windows, events, colors), and the practical application of mathematics for efficient algorithms.\n\n**Mandatory Requirements:**\n\n*   **Technology:** Developed in C, utilizing the `miniLibX` graphics library and standard C/math functions. `libft` is authorized.\n*   **Visuals:** Display different wall textures based on their facing direction (North, South, East, West), and allow distinct colors for the floor and ceiling.\n*   **Interaction:** Implement movement (W, A, S, D keys) and viewpoint rotation (left/right arrow keys). The program must exit cleanly via the ESC key or clicking the window's red cross.\n*   **Input:** The program takes a scene description file with a `.cub` extension as an argument. This file specifies:\n    *   Paths to North, South, East, West wall textures (`NO`, `SO`, `WE`, `EA`).\n    *   RGB colors for the Floor (`F`) and Ceiling (`C`).\n    *   A map composed of '0' (empty space), '1' (wall), and 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' for the player's starting position and orientation.\n    *   The map must be closed/surrounded by walls.\n    *   The parsing of elements (textures, colors, map) is flexible regarding order, spaces, and empty lines.\n*   **Error Handling:** Any misconfiguration in the `.cub` file must cause the program to exit cleanly with an \"Error\\\\n\" message followed by a specific error description.\n\n**General Instructions:**\n\n*   Adhere to \"the Norm\" coding style, ensure proper memory management (no leaks, no unexpected crashes), and follow specific Makefile rules (`all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`, `bonus`).\n*   **AI Usage Guidelines:** Provides instructions for the ethical and effective use of AI tools, emphasizing critical assessment, developing prompting skills, collaborating with peers for validation, and taking full responsibility for any AI-generated content. It discourages blind copy-pasting and encourages understanding and peer review.\n\n**Bonus Part:**\nOptional features, evaluated only if the mandatory part is \"perfect,\" include wall collisions, a minimap, openable/closable doors, animated sprites, and mouse-controlled viewpoint rotation.\n\n**Submission and Evaluation:**\nProjects are submitted via a Git repository. During peer-evaluation, students may be asked to perform minor modifications to verify their understanding of specific project parts."

Crucially, they must **fully understand and take responsibility for any AI-generated content** and always seek peer review for validation.\n4.  **Mandatory Part (`miniRT`):**\n    *   The program takes a scene description file (`.rt` extension) as an argument.\n    *   It must render scenes featuring ambient light, a camera, a light source, and at least three geometric objects: **planes, spheres, and cylinders.**\n    *   Features include object resizing and transformations (translation/rotation), ambient and diffuse lighting, hard shadows, and proper window management (close on ESC or red cross click).\n    *   The `.rt` file format is strictly defined for elements like `A` (Ambient), `C` (Camera), `L` (Light), `sp` (Sphere), `pl` (Plane), and `cy` (Cylinder), with specific parameters and constraints.\n    *   Error handling for misconfigured scene files is required.\n5.  **Bonus Part:**\n    *   Optional enhancements include specular reflection (Phong model), checkerboard patterns, colored/multi-spot lights, additional 2nd-degree objects (e.g., cone), and bump mapping.\n    *   **Bonuses are only evaluated if the mandatory part is deemed absolutely perfect and fully functional.**\n6.  **Submission and Evaluation:** Projects are submitted via Git. During evaluation, minor modifications may be requested to verify the developer's understanding of the code."

This involves downloading a file, extracting it, and running an `index.html` file in a web browser (Google Chrome or Chromium-based browsers are recommended, as Firefox may not function). For each level, a non-functioning network diagram is presented with specific goals. Learners must configure IP addresses, connect devices through routers, and understand gateways by modifying unshaded fields. Tools like \"Check again\" to verify configuration and \"Get my config\" to export solutions are provided, along with logs for debugging.\n\n**Key Learning Concepts:**\nThe activity focuses on understanding TCP/IP addressing, subnet masks, default gateways, and the roles of routers and switches.\n\n**AI Usage Guidelines:**\nThe document provides specific guidelines for using AI tools:\n*   Use AI to reduce repetitive tasks and develop prompting skills.\n*   Critically assess AI-generated content, as accuracy is not guaranteed.\n*   Only use AI-generated content that is fully understood, and for which the learner can take full responsibility.\n*   Systematically check, review, question, and test AI output.\n*   Prioritize peer review and collaboration, as peers can offer more relevant insights and alternative perspectives than AI. Avoid blindly copy-pasting AI solutions without understanding or validation.\n\n**Submission Requirements:**\n*   **10 configuration files:** After successfully completing each of the 10 levels, learners must use the \"Get my config\" button (after entering their login in the interface) to export their solution. All 10 exported files must be placed at the root of their Git repository.\n*   **README.md:** A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the repository, written in English. It must include:\n    *   An italicized first line stating \"This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by <login1>[, <login2>[, <login3>[...]]].\"\n    *   A \"Description\" section outlining the project's goal.\n    *   An \"Instructions\" section explaining how to run the training interface, export configurations, and the submission details (10 files at root).\n    *   A \"Resources\" section listing classic references, specifying networking concepts studied (e.g., TCP/IP addressing, subnet mask, default gateway, routers, switches, OSI layers), and detailing *how AI was used for specific tasks*.\n\n**Evaluation:**\nDuring the defense, learners will be required to successfully complete **three random levels** from the training platform within a limited time.

They cycle through states of eating, thinking, and sleeping. The primary goal is to prevent any philosopher from starving while avoiding data races and adhering to strict logging rules.\n\n**Key requirements and features:**\n\n*   **Language:** C.\n*   **Coding Standards:** Strict adherence to norms, proper memory management, no global variables, specific Makefile rules.\n*   **Arguments:** The program takes command-line arguments: `number_of_philosophers`, `time_to_die`, `time_to_eat`, `time_to_sleep`, and an optional `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat`.\n*   **Mandatory Part (`philo`):**\n    *   Each philosopher must be represented as a separate **thread**.\n    *   **Mutexes** are used to protect the state of each fork, preventing simultaneous access.\n    *   Allowed functions include `pthread_*` functions for thread and mutex management.\n*   **Bonus Part (`philo_bonus`):**\n    *   Each philosopher must be represented as a separate **process**.\n    *   **Semaphores** are used to manage the availability of forks.\n    *   Allowed functions include `fork`, `kill`, `waitpid`, and `sem_*` functions for process and semaphore management.\n    *   This part is only evaluated if the mandatory part is completed perfectly.\n*   **AI Instructions:** Guidelines are provided on how to ethically and effectively use AI tools for assistance, emphasizing understanding, critical assessment, and peer collaboration over direct copy-pasting.\n*   **Submission:** Projects are submitted via Git, with specific directory structures for mandatory and bonus parts. Evaluators may request minor modifications during assessment to verify understanding."

The use of a personal `libft` is permitted.\n3.  **AI Instructions:** Students are encouraged to use AI tools for repetitive tasks and to develop prompting skills, but *must fully understand and take responsibility* for any AI-generated content. Critical assessment and peer review are emphasized as crucial for validating AI output.\n4.  **Mandatory Features:**\n    *   Signal handling using at most one global variable to store the signal number.\n    *   Interpretation of single quotes (`'`) to prevent meta-character interpretation.\n    *   Interpretation of double quotes (`\"`) to prevent most meta-character interpretation, but allowing `$ ` (dollar sign) expansion.\n    *   Implementation of I/O redirections: `<`, `>`, `<<` (heredoc), and `>>` (append).\n    *   Pipes (`|`) to connect command outputs to inputs.\n    *   Expansion of environment variables (`$VAR`) and the exit status (`$?`).\n    *   Specific handling for Ctrl-C (new prompt), Ctrl-D (exit), and Ctrl-\\ (do nothing) in interactive mode.\n    *   Built-in commands: `echo -n`, `cd` (relative/absolute path), `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.\n    *   Bash is the reference for ambiguous requirements.\n5.  **Bonus Features (evaluated only if mandatory is perfect):**\n    *   Logical operators `&&` and `||` with parentheses for priority.\n    *   Wildcards (`*`) for the current working directory.\n6.  **Submission & Evaluation:** Projects are submitted via Git. During evaluation, minor code modifications may be requested to verify understanding."

This file contains numbers representing points in space, where their horizontal position is the x-coordinate, vertical is the y-coordinate, and the value is the altitude (z-coordinate).\n*   **Rendering:** The program must display the landscape in **isometric projection** within a window.\n*   **Technical Requirements:**\n    *   Written in **C language**, adhering to coding norms.\n    *   Uses the **MiniLibX library** for window and image management.\n    *   Authorized external functions include basic I/O (`open`, `read`, `write`), memory management (`malloc`, `free`), error handling, math functions (`-lm`), `gettimeofday()`, and `ft_printf` (or equivalent).\n    *   A `Makefile` must be provided, and students can use their `libft`.\n    *   No global variables are allowed.\n    *   The program must manage the window smoothly and exit cleanly (e.g., pressing ESC or clicking the close button).\n*   **AI Instructions:** Guidelines are provided for the ethical and effective use of AI tools, emphasizing critical assessment, developing prompting skills, peer review, and taking full responsibility for AI-generated content.\n*   **Bonus Part:** Additional features such as other projections (parallel, conic), zoom, translation, rotation, and one custom bonus can be implemented for extra points. **The bonus part is only evaluated if the mandatory part is perfectly completed.**\n*   **Submission & Evaluation:** Projects are submitted via Git, and peer evaluations may include a brief modification request to verify understanding."

Its primary purpose is to teach students about textures, sprites, window management, event handling, and basic game mechanics, while also reinforcing C programming skills and rigorous development practices.\n\nThe mandatory part involves creating a game where a player character navigates a `.ber` map to collect all items and reach an exit. The map must be rectangular, enclosed by walls, contain exactly one player start ('P') and one exit ('E'), at least one collectible ('C') (with no duplicates), and have a valid path, with robust error handling for misconfigurations. Players move using WASD/arrow keys, cannot pass through walls, and the game must display the current move count in the shell. Window management should be smooth, closing cleanly via ESC or the 'X' button.\n\nDevelopment requirements include adherence to the Norm, proper memory management (no leaks or crashes), and a specific Makefile structure. Guidelines for using AI tools are also provided, emphasizing their use for repetitive tasks, developing prompting skills, and critical assessment, urging students to only use content they fully understand and have validated with peers.\n\nAn optional bonus section, evaluated only if the mandatory part is perfectly met, allows for features like enemy patrols (player loses on touch), sprite animations, or on-screen movement display. Projects are submitted via Git, and evaluations may include minor on-the-spot modifications to assess understanding."

The primary goal is to find and display the *shortest possible sequence* of these instructions.\n\n2.  **Mandatory Program (`push_swap`):**\n    *   **Input:** A list of unique positive and/or negative integers provided as arguments.\n    *   **Output:** The calculated optimal sequence of instructions, separated by newlines, to sort `stack a` with the smallest number at the top.\n    *   **Performance:** The program must meet strict benchmarks for the number of operations, e.g., sorting 100 numbers in fewer than 700 operations and 500 numbers in fewer than 5500 operations for full validation.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Must display \"Error\" followed by a newline to standard error for invalid inputs (non-integers, duplicates, numbers exceeding integer limits).\n    *   **Technical Constraints:** Must be written in C, comply with the Norm, use a Makefile, avoid global variables, and manage memory properly. `libft` is authorized.\n\n3.  **Bonus Program (`checker`):**\n    *   **Evaluation Condition:** This part is only assessed if the mandatory `push_swap` project is *perfect* (all benchmarks met).\n    *   **Functionality:** Takes an initial stack `a` as arguments, then reads instructions from standard input. It executes these instructions.\n    *   **Output:** Displays \"OK\" if `stack a` is sorted and `stack b` is empty after execution, otherwise \"KO\". Includes error handling for invalid arguments or instructions.\n\n4.  **Learning Objectives:** Develop rigor, proficiency in C, and an understanding of basic algorithms and their complexity.\n\n5.  **AI Usage Guidelines:** Encourages exploring and using AI tools responsibly to reduce repetitive tasks and improve prompting skills. Emphasizes critical assessment, peer review, and understanding AI-generated content rather than blindly copy-pasting.\n\n6.  **Submission:** Requires a `Makefile`, source files, and a `README.md` file that describes the project, instructions, resources, and explicitly details how AI was used."

The server acknowledges each received message by sending a signal back to the client.\n2.  Support for Unicode characters.\n\n**General Project & AI Instructions:**\nThe document also includes common coding standards, guidelines for ethical and effective use of AI tools (emphasizing understanding, critical assessment, and peer review of AI-generated content), and submission details, noting that peer evaluations may involve a brief live modification to verify understanding."

It should return `NULL` if there's nothing else to read or an error occurs.\n*   **Core Concept:** The project aims to teach the use of static variables in C.\n*   **Constraints:**\n    *   Cannot use `libft`, `lseek()`, or global variables.\n    *   Must use `read`, `malloc`, and `free`.\n    *   `BUFFER_SIZE` must be defined as a compiler flag (`-D BUFFER_SIZE=n`).\n    *   The function should not read the entire file at once but rather read as little as possible.\n*   **Files:** `get_next_line.c`, `get_next_line_utils.c`, `get_next_line.h`.\n\n**General Project Instructions:**\n*   Projects must be written in C, conform to the 42 Norm, avoid crashes (segmentation faults, bus errors) and memory leaks.\n*   A `Makefile` is required with `$(NAME)`, `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`, and `bonus` rules, compiling with `cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror`.\n*   Submission is via a Git repository. Testing is highly encouraged.\n\n**AI Usage Policy:**\n*   Students are encouraged to use AI tools thoughtfully, focusing on learning, reasoning, and peer collaboration rather than obtaining direct answers or shortcuts. The learning process is emphasized over just the result. AI usage must be clearly described in the `README.md`.\n\n**README Requirements:**\n*   A `README.md` file is mandatory, including a specific introductory line, a project description, compilation/execution instructions, a \"Resources\" section detailing any AI usage, and a detailed explanation and justification of the chosen algorithm.\n\n**Bonus Part:**\n*   The bonus section requires implementing `get_next_line()` using **only one static variable** and enabling it to **manage multiple file descriptors concurrently** (e.g., reading from fd 3, then 4, then 5, then 3 again, without losing state).\n*   Bonus files must have a `_bonus` suffix (e.g., `get_next_line_bonus.c`).\n*   The bonus part is **only assessed if the mandatory part is perfectly implemented and fully functional.**\n\n**Submission & Evaluation:**\n*   Thorough testing with various `BUFFER_SIZE` values, line sizes, and file types is critical.\n*   Students should be prepared for potential on-the-spot modifications or behavioral changes requested by evaluators during defense."

    "text": "libft This document outlines the \"Libft\" project, which requires participants to create their own C library (`libft.a`) containing a diverse set of general-purpose utility functions.\n\n**Project Goals:**\nThe primary objective is to help students understand the underlying mechanisms of standard C library functions by reimplementing them. This also serves to build a valuable, reusable library for future C programming assignments.\n\n**Mandatory Parts:**\n\n1.  **Libc Functions:** Reimplement a specified set of standard C library functions (e.g., `isalpha`, `strlen`, `memcpy`, `malloc`, `strdup`). These custom functions must have identical prototypes and behavior to their originals but be prefixed with `ft_` (e.g., `ft_strlen`).\n2.  **Additional Functions:** Develop new utility functions that extend beyond the standard C library or offer different implementations. These include advanced string manipulation (`ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strtrim`, `ft_split`), integer to ASCII conversion (`ft_itoa`), character iteration with callback functions (`ft_strmapi`, `ft_striteri`), and functions for outputting characters/strings/integers to a specified file descriptor (`ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`, `ft_putendl_fd`, `ft_putnbr_fd`).\n3.  **Linked List Functions:** Implement a suite of functions to manage a singly linked list, utilizing a predefined `t_list` structure. This includes functions for creating nodes (`ft_lstnew`), adding nodes (`ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstadd_back`), navigating (`ft_lstsize`, `ft_lstlast`), deleting nodes/lists (`ft_lstdelone`, `ft_lstclear`), and iterating or mapping across the list's content (`ft_lstiter`, `ft_lstmap`).\n\n**General Requirements and Constraints:**\n\n*   **Coding Standards:** Projects must be written in C, adhere to \"the Norm\" (coding style guide), and functions must not quit unexpectedly (e.g., segmentation fault, memory leaks).\n*   **Memory Management:** All heap-allocated memory must be properly freed.\n*   **Makefile:** A `Makefile` is mandatory, including rules for `$(NAME)`, `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`, and a `bonus` rule for optional features. It must compile with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` flags.\n*   **Library Creation:** The `libft.a` archive must be created using the `ar` command. Global variables are forbidden, and helper functions should be `static`.\n*   **AI Usage:** Strict guidelines are provided against using AI for direct answers or as a shortcut. The emphasis is on genuine intellectual effort, reasoning, and peer-learning to develop foundational skills.\n\n**Submission and Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Submission:** Files (Makefile, `libft.h`, `ft_*.c`) must be placed at the root of a Git repository.\n*   **README.md:** A detailed `README.md` file is required, including a project description, compilation/execution instructions, resources used (with specific details on AI usage), and a comprehensive description of the created library.\n*   **Evaluation:** During peer evaluation, evaluators may request small, on-the-spot code modifications to verify the student's understanding of the project."
